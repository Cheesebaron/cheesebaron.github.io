Hey there!

I am Tomasz Cielecki also known as [@Cheesebaron]({{ site.author.url }}). I am a Microsoft MVP for Visual Studio and Development Technologies awarded for helping out in the Xamarin/.NET community by answering questions on forums, Discord and other media. I have also spoken at various local user group events.

I work as a Technical Lead at [TrackMan](https://trackman.com), where I develop mobile applications using C#, [Xamarin](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/xamarin) and [MvvmCross](https://mvvmcross.com).

The blog posts you will find here on the site, will vary from posts on how to do simple things to comprehensive guides, mainly focused towards Mobile App development related. However, you may find a some IoT and DevOps related posts too. If you have ideas for topics for me to cover do not hesitate to contact me.
