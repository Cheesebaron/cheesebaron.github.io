A wild podcast has appeared, this one is called <a href="http://gonemobile.io/" target="_blank">Gone Mobile</a> and made by some cool guys including Greg Shackles (<a href="http://twitter.com/gshackles" target="_blank">@gshackles</a>), Nic Wise (<a href="http://twitter.com/fastchicken" target="_blank">@fastchicken</a>) and Jonathan Dick (<a href="http://twitter.com/redth" target="_blank">@redth</a>). The podcast as the title says is about Mobile stuff, including news, interviews with people in the industry and much more. The first episode has already aired, which I though was quite enjoyable and I will listen to it in the future.<br />If you have not given it a listen, I advise you to and see for yourself if it is interesting. The podcast is also available on iTunes if you are into that kind of stuff.
