Dear readers,<br /><br />I have come to the conclusion that hosting a blog myself is too much hassle. Keeping CMS up to date etc., hence I have started a new blog at blogger.com instead. This way I can concentrate on posting content instead of managing the CMS.<br /><br />Hope to see you here soon, where I will post some goodies for you to read.<br /><br />//Tomasz <pre class="brush: csharp"><br />while(true)<br />    Console.WriteLine("Live long and prosper");<br /></pre>
