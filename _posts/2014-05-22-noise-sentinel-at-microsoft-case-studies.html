Microsoft just recently released a case study regarding one of the products I work on at Brüel &amp; Kjær, namely Noise Sentinel. This case study is based on the usage of Microsoft Azure and the services Microsoft provides and how they have helped innovating the product.<br /><br />You can read the case study here: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/casestudies/Microsoft-Azure/Bruel-Kj-r-Sound-Vibration-Measurement-A-S/Global-enterprise-explore-new-business-opportunities-with-Microsoft-Azure/710000004464" target="_blank">Microsoft Case Study</a><br /><br />
