I just read a news post on slashdot about <a href="http://linux.slashdot.org/story/12/10/16/1245244/reiser4-file-system-still-in-development" target="_blank">Reiser4 FS was updated on SourceForge</a> very recently and it seems that it is still being developed, even though <a href="http://yro.slashdot.org/story/08/08/30/0045257/hans-reiser-gets-sentence-of-15-to-life" target="_blank">Hans Reiser was convicted for murdering his wife</a>. This news stirred up some very funny comments, which I will posts a couple off them here:<br /><br /><a href="http://linux.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=3188949&amp;cid=41667867" target="_blank">concealment</a> wrote:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">If you can find any name that's not related to murdering your wife, go for it. Bonus points if it's catchy.</blockquote><div><a href="http://linux.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=3188949&amp;cid=41667887" target="_blank">Anonymous</a>&nbsp;answered:</div><blockquote class="tr_bq">My vote for MRDRFS.</blockquote>a reply from&nbsp;<a href="http://linux.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=3188949&amp;cid=41668581" target="_blank">tobiasly</a>:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">REDRUMFS. As long as you don't use it for mirroring, no one will know.</blockquote>A <a href="http://linux.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=3188949&amp;cid=41667957" target="_blank">comment from serviscope_minor</a>:<br /><blockquote>There's going to be a few off color jokes. May as well get started.<br />* It's a killer filesystem.<br />* My disk died. Was ReiserFS the murderer?<br />* It's more cutting edge than Reiser's knife.</blockquote><a href="http://linux.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=3188949&amp;cid=41670879" target="_blank">Jeremiah Cornelius</a> replied:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">Kernel merge expected</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">in 20 years to life.</blockquote>There are probably more jokes in the comments.
