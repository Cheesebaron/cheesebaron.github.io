Some years ago I ported over some Java color pickers to work with Xamarin. However, it didn't really cross my mind to release these as a NuGet package. However, due to demand I finally took the time to do so.

You can find the NuGet package here: https://www.nuget.org/packages/Cheesebaron.ColorPickers/

The source code as usual is available on GitHub: https://github.com/Cheesebaron/Cheesebaron.ColorPickers

Here is a couple of screen shots of what you can expect from the library.
