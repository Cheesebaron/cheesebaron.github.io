Hey there!

I am Tomasz Cielecki also better known as [@Cheesebaron]({{ site.author.url }}). I am a Microsoft MVP for Visual Studio and Development Technologies awarded for helping out in the Xamarin community by answering questions on forums, Slack and other media. I have also spoken at various local user group events.

The blog posts you will find here will vary from posts on how to do simple things to comprehensive guides. If you have ideas for topics for me to cover do not hesitate to contact me.
