Just recently found out that there is an awesome plug-in for MonoDevelop, which allows for using TFS directly in MonoDevelop. Before I found this plug-in I was using Microsoft Team Explorer Everywhere (TEE), which provided a command line tool, where I could manually check out and check in files, which was quite tedious.<br /><br />TeamAddins does things similarly to what TFS does in Visual Studio, where it automagically checks out files when editing them and so on.<br /><br />This plug-in is really awesome if you use TFS in your development environment.  To use it simply fire up MonoDevelop, open up the MonoDevelop menu and choose <b>Add-In Manager</b>. Choose the <b>Gallery tab</b>, in the drop down menu choose <b>Manage Repositories</b>. In the new window press <b>Add</b>&nbsp;and &nbsp;fill out the URL with: <b>http://www.teamaddins.com/monodevelop/3.0 </b>Now refresh the repositories and a new item under <b>Version Control</b>&nbsp;called <b>Team Foundatation Server Add-In</b>&nbsp;should appear. Install this and you are ready to set up your workspace and TFS server connections.<br /><br />Find more information on <a href="http://www.teamaddins.com/blog/" target="_blank">TeamAddins' web page</a>.
