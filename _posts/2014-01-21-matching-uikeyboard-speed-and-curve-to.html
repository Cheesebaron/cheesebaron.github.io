I have a ViewController in my Xamarin.iOS application, where i scale the View Frame when the keyboard shows. However, I had some trouble with matching the speed and curve of the animation to the keyboards animation. Though I found a pretty good solution, which takes the values from the keyboard itself, through the <i>UIKeyboardWillShowNotification.</i><br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/Cheesebaron/8539458.js"></script>
