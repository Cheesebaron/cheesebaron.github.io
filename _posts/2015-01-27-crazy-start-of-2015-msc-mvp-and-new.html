End of 2014 and this month have been a very busy time for me. I have been working very hard on finishing up my Masters Thesis, <i>"Environmental Sensor Monitoring tablet application designed using cross-platform design patterns and frameworks"</i>, which in short terms concerns creating cross-platform applications using C#, Windows 8.1 SDK and the Xamarin SDK, using some design patterns and frameworks which help sharing code across the targeted platforms. The thesis was handed in the 19th of January and defended today 27th of January. I managed to get an <b>A</b> for the project, which I am super happy about.<br /><br />Brüel &amp; Kjær which I made the thesis in collaboration with and where I have been working part time the past 3.5 years also offered me a more permanent position last year, which I have accepted, which means I am starting full time from February, continuing creating cross-platform apps using Xamarin.<br /><br />Alongside the thesis, I've been in the middle of buying an apartment, which is almost settled now. So the plan is that I am going to move 1st of March, which is going to be great. Right now I am living in a small dorm room, where I just have enough room for a desk, bed and some storage furniture. It is going to be great to get around 8 times the space of the dorm room.<br /><br />Last but not least, I have been awarded a Xamarin Most Valuable Professional (MVP) award, which was announced a couple of days ago. I am really honored to get such an award and this is my first MVP award ever. Hopefully I will live up to the award and get a new one at the end of the year.<br /><br />Looking forward to tackle this year and get the best out of it, get cracking at some code and provide answers to your questions on the community forums etc. I am planning on creating more tutorial videos, like I have done previously, which seem to be quite popular. If you have any topics you want covered related to Xamarin, do post a comment and I might just make a video on that.
